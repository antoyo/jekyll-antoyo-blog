== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with https://rust-gcc.github.io/[gccrs], which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

We implemented new patches that are yet to be sent to the mailing list:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/gcc/commit/4b9b1786acf6bcb78fcd93f56be9f85448610995[Add support for the weak variable attribute]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/gcc/commit/ec8ae43f9c04597011299d0d5d031d8074f3115d[jit: Fix volatile loads and stores] (thanks to YakoYakoYokuYoku)

We got reviews of many patches that were sent in the past and many of them were merged:

I'm happy to see progress on this side.

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

Apart from that, I was working on a https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/565[sync with the Rust compiler] and was having issues with the `stdarch` tests again. If I don't make progress on this soon, I'll disable some of these tests since it's blocking me too often.

Next month, I'll finish this sync, I'll add the support for non-default ABIs and improve the documentation for new contributors.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job where LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

To do so, follow https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#building[these instructions to build the project] and run a program via the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo[`cargo` command of our script].

If you find a bug, https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues[please open an issue].

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.

== Thanks for your support!
