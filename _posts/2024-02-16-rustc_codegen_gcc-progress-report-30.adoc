== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, we prepared and sent the following patches to the mailing list:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2024q1/001804.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add support for creating temporary variables]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2024q1/001805.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Allow comparing array types]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2024q1/001806.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add gcc_jit_global_set_readonly]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2024q1/001821.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Clear pending_assemble_externals_processed]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2024q1/001827.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add count zeroes builtins to ensure_optimization_builtins_exist]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2024q1/001831.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Do not treat warnings as errors]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2024q1/001832.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add option to allow special characters in function names]

In addition, the following patch was merged:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001762.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Implement sizeof operator]

We also rebased our GCC fork to have the latest upstream changes, got some reviews on our patches and addressed some of them already.

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

We're finally done sending patches to GCC!
Next month, we'll address the review of the patches that were already sent and hopefully merge most of them.
We'll also continue towards our goal of distributing this project through `rustup`, which should hopefully happens in a couple of months.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

=== UI tests progress

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the CI:

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job where LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
