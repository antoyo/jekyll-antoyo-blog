== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with https://rust-gcc.github.io/[gccrs], which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

We implemented new patches that are yet to be sent to the mailing list:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/gcc/commit/d6f5a708104a98199ac0f01a3b6b279a0f7c66d3[libgccjit: Add the function attributes for setting the ABI]

We also had our patch to reorganize the CPU feature detection code to remove duplication between `gccrs` and `rustc_codegen_gcc`:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=2d0fc643a0c837064f92f0b3122988b841b74b5f

I hope this is the first of many contributions we'll have between the two projects and that we can continue to collaborate with and help each other.

We also got reviews of some patches that were sent in the past.

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

Apart from that, there was a lot of progress towards having `rustup` distribution thanks to Kobzol:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135638[Make it possible to build GCC on CI]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136921[Build GCC on CI]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/137667[Add `dist::Gcc` build step]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/138051[Add support for downloading GCC from CI]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/138451[Build GCC on CI with GCC, not Clang]

Let's hope that we can get `rustup` distribution soon in order to make it easier for people to try this project.

I still struggle with https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/645[the current sync]: this time, I'm blocked by a regression in `libm`.
Hopefully, these PRs will be merged soon in order to unblock me:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/libm/pull/532[Reenable the use of the force-soft-floats feature]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/pull/810[Reenable the use of the force-soft-floats feature in `compiler-builtins`]

Next month, I'll finish this sync, I'll continue adding support for other non-default ABIs and improve the documentation for new contributors.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

To do so, follow https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#building[these instructions to build the project] and run a program via the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo[`cargo` command of our script].

If you find a bug, https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues[please open an issue].

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.

== Thanks for your support!
