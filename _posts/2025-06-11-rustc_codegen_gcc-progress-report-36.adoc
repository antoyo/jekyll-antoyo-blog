== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with https://rust-gcc.github.io/[gccrs], which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

No progress on this front in the past month.

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/702[Fix sysroot Cargo.lock]

Also, we've had a https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/ci-rustc_codegen_gcc[CI to test Rust for Linux compiled with `rustc_codegen_gcc`] for a while now and I fixed it recently.

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

Once again, I still struggle with https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/694[the current sync].
In order to make it easier in the future and avoid having frequent breakage of `rustc_codegen_gcc` with the changes made in the Rust repo, I want compile the sysroot with `rustc_codegen_gcc` in the CI of the Rust repository: that way, this should catch much more errors than with the tests that we currently have.
This will allow me to focus more on making progress on actual work, rather than fixing issues that should not happen if we had better testing.

As you can see, we got many contributions from FractalFir, which is doing the https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/05/08/gsoc-2025-selected-projects/[Google Summer of Code with us this year]: we're super happy to have a such talented person helping us moving things forward!

Next month, I'll finish this sync, attempt to reenable some tests https://blog.antoyo.xyz/rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-33[that were disabled in a previous sync] and continue my work on fixing Link-Time Optimization which doesn't work properly in some cases.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

To do so, follow https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#building[these instructions to build the project] and run a program via the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo[`cargo` command of our script].

If you find a bug, https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues[please open an issue].

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.

== Thanks for your support!
