== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with https://rust-gcc.github.io/[gccrs], which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

There wasn't much progress in the past 2 months on this side, but one patch was merged upstream:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=6c565e9b32bc1e95aa2ec869285d9f51b3c45f96[libgccjit: Fix test-cold-attribute.c]

As you may have https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qk9t1t/the_rust_gcc_backend_can_now_be_installed_with/[seen on Reddit], `rustc_codegen_gcc` is now distributed on rustup!
Thanks a lot to Kobzol, bjorn3, GuillaumeGomez and all others who helped with this.
It is to be noted that there are some issues with it (especially proc-macros) since it uses a standard library compiled with a LLVM-based rustc (most likely an ABI issue).
I will do a proper announcement blog post after adding some tests of the rustup artifacts: this will allow make to quickly fix any issues that arise there.
For now, it is only distributed for Linux x86-64.

I have an idea of what could be the issue here and if it is what I think, it might take a couple months to have a proper fix for this since GCC gives less control over the ABI than LLVM.
In the next months, I attempt to fix this or at least provide a temporary workaround to make sure that the version distributed by rustup works as well as the version in the project repository.
Also, I'll get back to my work of building a working `rustc` for m68k.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

To do so, follow https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#building[these instructions to build the project] and run a program via the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo[`cargo` command of our script].

If you find a bug, https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues[please open an issue].

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
