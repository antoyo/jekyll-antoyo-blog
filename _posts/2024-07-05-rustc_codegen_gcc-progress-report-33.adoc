== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

We implemented a new patch that is yet to be sent to the mailing list:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/gcc/pull/44[[PATCH\] Allow gcc_jit_type_get_size to work with pointers] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

We got reviews of some patches that were sent in the past and some of them were merged:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git;h=1c314247aab43aaa278ecc51d666f8c5896d8bbb[libgccjit: Add support for the type bfloat16]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git;h=533f807e17034b20c586eeb480c989a42869bb36[libgccjit: Allow comparing array types]

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done during the past month:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/17[Add support for Float16, Float32, Float64 and Float128] (thanks to zedar!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/524[ui pattern failure tests] (thanks to lordshashank!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/529[prevent libgccjit.so download on unsupported os/arch] (thanks to Skgland!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/526[Improve Readme.md format] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/519[simd: implement pointer provenance intrinsics] (thanks to sadlerap!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/523[adding more env vars] (thanks to Gerson2102!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/535[Sync from rust 2024/07/02]

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

This month, the main highlight is the support for the new types `f16` and `f128` (thanks to zedar!).

We also were able to finish the sync with the Rust compiler, which was much harder than usual, so we'll be able to get back on working on `rustup` support.
We did many attempts to sync with the Rust compiler since March because we had a very hard time keeping up with all the changes in the Rust compiler that break things every now and then:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/11[Take #1]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/505[Take #2]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/520[Take #3]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/532[Take #4]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/535[Take #5]

It does not help that we have tooling issues for those syncs (`git subtree` being the main culprit here).
Moreover, one change that was particularly difficult to mimic in `libgccjit` was that `rustc` will now change the type of some global variables after they were created.
We finally merged the sync PR by marking as ignored some tests that used to pass (to be able to move on and fix those later), and we had to generate fat LTO objects in some cases where only the bitcode was request, so I'll try to fix those after my vacation.

We plan to enable more tests in the CI of the Rust repo for `rustc_codegen_gcc` in order to avoid having that many problems in the future for the sync.

Next month, we'll fix those issues and we'll continue towards our goal of distributing this project through `rustup`, which should hopefully happens in a couple of months.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job where LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

To do so, follow https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#building[these instructions to build the project] and run a program via the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo[`cargo` command of our script].

If you find a bug, https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues[please open an issue].

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
