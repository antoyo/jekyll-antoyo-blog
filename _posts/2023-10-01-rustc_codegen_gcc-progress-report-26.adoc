== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, I did the following commits, which are yet to be sent on the gcc mailing list:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/29[Fix CPU feature detection]
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/30[Implement sizeof]

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done during the past month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/324[Only apply NoAlias attribute if optimization is enabled] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/327[Fix gimple guide] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/337[Fix gep on pointers to non-number]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/343[Add guide to add new attributes support in libgccjit] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/344[Improve y.sh script] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

It was announced link:{% post_url 2022-10-07-rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-16 %}[last year] that `rustc_codegen_gcc` can compile https://rust-for-linux.com/[Rust for Linux] with very few hacks.
Today, I'm happy to announce that it can compile Rust for Linux without any patches! (Well, we still need patches to GCC itself like the rest of `rustc_codegen_gcc`, but those will be merged upstream eventually.)

// TODO: move to after the features table.

=== State of compiling popular crates

If was asked from time to time to test compiling the most popular crates with `rustc_codegen_gcc` and I finally did so.
Here are the results of running the tests of the most popular crates.

|===

As you can see, `rustc_codegen_gcc` successfully run and pass all the tests of all those crates. I had to fix a few small bugs in order to achieve this result and they were merged last month.
The tests from `base64` seem to have a memory leak when using the GCC codegen: I'm going the investigate this issue in the future.

In addition to running those tests, I was able to successfully run https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/process-viewer[process-viewer] and it seemed to work properly.

Next month, I plan to continue working on correctly handling the endianness for non-native 128-bit integers.
This month, I setup the CI to be able to cross-compile to the `m68k` architecture in order to be able to run the integers test.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job where LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
