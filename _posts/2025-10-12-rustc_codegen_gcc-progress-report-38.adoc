== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with https://rust-gcc.github.io/[gccrs], which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

There's been some nice progress on the GCC side these past months.

A few patches were sent for review:

 * https://forge.sourceware.org/gcc/gcc-TEST/pulls/74[libgccjit: Add gcc_jit_type_is_floating_point]
 * https://forge.sourceware.org/gcc/gcc-TEST/pulls/82[libgccjit: Add _Float16, _Float32, _Float64 and __float128 support for jit]
 * https://forge.sourceware.org/gcc/gcc-TEST/pulls/86[libgccjit: Fix is_same_type_as for vector type]
 * https://forge.sourceware.org/gcc/gcc-TEST/pulls/87[libgccjit: Handle missing types in jit_langhook_type_for_mode]
 * https://forge.sourceware.org/gcc/gcc-TEST/pulls/95[libgccjit: Fix error on Power architectures caused by wrong jit_target_objs]

As you can see, those patches were sent to a forge: this forge is an experiment by the GCC devs and I hope this is going to be a success since it really helps with the reviews among other things.

Also, I finally got this big patch merged:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=2a54db2d8baa1de9d552dfd561849f59737c062f[libgccjit: Add ability to get CPU features]

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done during the past months:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/753[Sync from rust 2025/08/25]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/755[Update GCC version]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/760[Sync from rust 2025/09/16]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/759[Always add git user info to run_command] (thanks to dvermd!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/763[Sync from rust 2025/09/30]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/768[Remove passing run-make tests]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/766[Fix and re-enable mini-core test]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/764[Stop ignoring the clippy lint suspicious_else_formatting]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/767[Clean all test directories]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/765[Fix shifting a value of a smaller type to a bigger type]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/769[Add test for cross-language LTO]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/772[Add dejagnu to the quickstart installation command line] (thanks to winstonallo!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/770[Update GCC version]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/678[Remove EMBED_LTO_BITCODE]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/773[Fix undefined symbols error with lto]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/778[Clean the sysroot destination directory before copying the content into it]

Will all this, we finally fixed the issues we had with LTO, so this feature should be working properly now.
Also, I managed to make cross-language LTO working!
This needed a fix on the Rust side:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/147127[Add a leading dash to linker plugin arguments in the gcc codegen]

Cross-language LTO is the ability to make optimizations between different programming languages.
For instance, we could have a function written in C in an object file, that gets inlined when called from Rust code.

With LTO done, the remaining big tasks are:

 * Finish debug info support
 * Add support for other architectures
 * Fix issues with unwinding
 * Rustup distribution

In the next months, I plan to continue sending GCC patches for review to hopefully get them merged for the next GCC release.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

To do so, follow https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#building[these instructions to build the project] and run a program via the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo[`cargo` command of our script].

If you find a bug, https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues[please open an issue].

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
