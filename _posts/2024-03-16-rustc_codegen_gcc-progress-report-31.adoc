== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, we addressed the reviews of all the patches that were sent. We're waiting for other rounds of review and approvals before we merge the patches.
Hopefully, we'll have most of the patches merged for the release of GCC 14.

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

This month, we continued our work towards having `rustup` distribution: we now use the default rust mangling scheme and we now build libgccjit in the Rust CI so that we run the tests will all the latest features of rustc_codegen_gcc in the Rust CI.
We also transferred the ownership of my [GCC fork](https://github.com/rust-lang/gcc) and the [gccjit.rs crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/gccjit.rs) to rust-lang in order to have all the dependencies of the GCC codegen owned by this organization.
We also saw the start of the implementation of debug info, thanks to tempdragon.

Next month, we'll address the review of the GCC patches that were already sent and hopefully merge most of them in time for the release of gcc 14.
We'll also continue towards our goal of distributing this project through `rustup`, which should hopefully happens in a couple of months.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job where LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
