<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote my last <a href="/rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-33">progress report about
<code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code></a>
(if you don&#8217;t know what this project is about, please look at <a href="/rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-33">the description in the last project report</a>).
We&#8217;ve been having some trouble making big progress lately, so I wanted to take a break from the usual article format that only
showed what progress has been made and instead write something more technical so you see what&#8217;s making it hard for us
to focus on making <code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code> ready to use.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="sync_with_upstream_rust">Sync with upstream Rust</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In today&#8217;s article, I wanted to talk about what we need to do to sync with the Rust compiler.
Like what happened <a href="/rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-33#state_of_rustc_codegen_gcc">at the beginning of the summer</a>,
we&#8217;re still having issues with making the sync with the Rust compiler.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="what_is_a_sync">What is a sync?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what&#8217;s a sync with the Rust compiler?
Before I explain what it is, I&#8217;ll explain how the GCC codegen works: it is a shared library that is loaded by the rust compiler.
It implements a bunch of traits from the <code>rustc_codegen_ssa</code> crate:
the functions in them specify how the specific backend generates code for a specific operation, for instance how to add 2 integers.
<code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code> pins a specific nightly version of the Rust compiler so that it continues to work even if the API changes on the <code>rustc</code> side.
So when I say I "sync with the Rust compiler", I mean that I increment this nightly version to one that is closer to today and pull the changes from the Rust repo:
<code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code> indeed lives in a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc">separate repo</a> and the Rust repo includes the project via a <code>git subtree</code>.
I can also sync back the changes from the <code>subtree</code> into the Rust repo (it&#8217;s much easier to sync this way).
We need to do this to stay up-to-date with the most recent changes of the Rust compiler and get the new features implemented.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="what_makes_it_hard_to_do_a_sync">What makes it hard to do a sync?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog post, I&#8217;ll only talk about why the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/556">current sync</a> is hard to do.
I might write other blog posts in the future about other issues with the sync and the different aspects of the development of <code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code> if there&#8217;s an interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the CI of the GCC codegen repo, we run many tests to make sure the codegen keeps working.
However, most of the time when we do a sync, some of these tests will fail, so we need to investigate why and the reason of those failures can take a long time to understand and to fix.
As mentioned in the last progress report, we even disabled some tests to be able to finish the sync and move on: none of those tests were re-enabled yet since we&#8217;re busy trying to do this sync.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="what_do_we_need_to_do_to_sync_with_the_rust_compiler">What do we need to do to sync with the Rust compiler?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing that we usually need to do is to update the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/tree/master/patches">patches</a> we have.
Most of them are related to testing: some will disable a few tests, others will allow us to run the tests of some sysroot crate more easily.
It is fortunately easy to update these patches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned previously, a sync will often break things.
In this case, we had the following errors when compiling a program using the standard library:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>/usr/bin/ld: /home/runner/work/rustc_codegen_gcc/rustc_codegen_gcc/build/build_sysroot/sysroot/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd.rlib<span class="tok-o">(</span>std.std.c6df57227ece985b-cgu.11.rcgu.o<span class="tok-o">)</span>:<span class="tok-o">(</span>.data.rel._rust_extern_with_linkage_pidfd_spawnp+0x0<span class="tok-o">)</span>:

<span class="tok-s1">/usr/bin/ld: /home/runner/work/rustc_codegen_gcc/rustc_codegen_gcc/build/build_sysroot/sysroot/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd.rlib(std.std.c6df57227ece985b-cgu.11.rcgu.o):(.data.rel._rust_extern_with_linkage_pidfd_getpid+0x0):</span>
<span class="tok-s1">undefined reference to `pidfd_getpid&#39;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This required a bit of investigation to figure out why this was happening.
We found out that we needed to add the support for the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/556/commits/0bdc5ffd685db3d1506dbf21c8df5daaf68aeaac"><code>weak</code> variable attribute</a> in order to fix this particular issue and to make some progress on the sync.
This required adding support for it <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/gcc/commit/bcafd46296f7898dac02d127e441b1d838ef2afc">in libgccjit</a> which is a bit of work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next thing that was a problem for this sync is that there were many AVX-512 intrinsics that were added.
Why is this a problem for us? It&#8217;s because they do not map 1-to-1 between GCC and LLVM.
As such, we need to maintain a mapping between them:
not only their name is different, but sometimes, their number of arguments or their order is different.
So we end up with code <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/blob/65e8717e4559bdfd30a0c6a05eb7f1241f53221e/src/intrinsic/llvm.rs#L70-L80">like this</a> to rearrange the arguments.
We also sometimes need to adjust the return value as can be seen below in this file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process to create this mapping is cumbersome:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>We compile <code>stdarch</code> (which takes close to 1 minute to complete with the GCC codegen on my PC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We look at the error telling us which intrinsic is missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We add the mapping for this intrinsic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We go back to step 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since in the current sync (which updates from Rust <code>nightly-2024-07-02</code> to <code>nightly-2024-08-11</code>) there were <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/compare/d3c9cc57d291efa09963add37b11cc52edcae19e..cb36d78d7ba5ddd1b148db955121f43aad9f5db4#diff-4fb378dd283a8400f8f8defde08413dc31a55b1a776c3fa2473e3f059061740c">more than 100 new intrinsics</a>, this process can take time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help go a bit faster, I modified a bit the code so that it doesn&#8217;t panic on the first missing intrinsic, but it will rarely show more than 5 missing intrinsics at a time since it will eventually fail with a type mismatch error in GCC at some point when I do that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help us with this process, we created a script that will try to auto-generate this mapping: it generates <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/blob/master/src/intrinsic/archs.rs">this file</a>.
However, since it uses files from LLVM, it&#8217;s not perfect: it&#8217;s missing many intrinsics and, sometimes, the name of the GCC builtins is wrong.
This also doesn&#8217;t help when the arguments need to be rearranged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that&#8217;s mostly where we&#8217;re at for the current sync: we&#8217;re close to being done with it (more than a month after we started).
There are still errors when running the <code>stdarch</code> tests, though.
One of them is actually a bug in GCC since it generates invalid assembly when using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">Intel syntax</a>: we now get this error:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>/tmp/libgccjit-4MRR1f/fake.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/libgccjit-4MRR1f/fake.s:171999: Error: operand size mismatch <span class="tok-k">for</span> <span class="tok-sb">`</span>vfpclasssd<span class="tok-s1">&#39;</span>
<span class="tok-s1">/tmp/libgccjit-4MRR1f/fake.s:172085: Error: operand size mismatch for `vfpclassss&#39;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not the first time I see this since the Intel syntax is much less tested in GCC than the AT&amp;T syntax: in fact, I already <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git;h=e484755aecd543b4c9e2adb4f348118c1e43cfd0">fixed a similar issue in the past</a>.
Since I&#8217;m less familiar with the backend part of GCC, it&#8217;s going to take some time before I find how to fix this bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also have another error that we need to fix:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="bash"><span></span>libgccjit.so: crates/core_arch/src/x86/avx512ifma.rs:136:5: error: :

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seems to suggest that we do something wrong with enabling target features at the function level: I haven&#8217;t started investigating this issue yet, though, so I might be wrong.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="prioritization">Prioritization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of that made me think perhaps it would help quite a bit to shift our priorities.
For instance, focusing on the latest AVX-512 intrinsics could perhaps be delayed so that the sync can be made faster and more easily.
Doing so would allow us to work on other, more important, features.
I&#8217;d still like to keep running the <code>stdarch</code> tests in our CI, though, so that what we have continues to work:
I&#8217;ll try to find a way to make sure the tests compile even without the missing intrinsics and to ignore the tests in this case.
Doing so could also create relatively simple tasks for new potential contributors: they could add a few missing intrinsics every now and then, a few at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I continue to do this exercise of explaining the work we do on <code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code>, I might think about other prioritization issues we might have.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, we&#8217;re struggling to keep up with the changes in rustc. For the current sync, the issue mostly was trying to stay up-to-date to support the newest AVX-512 intrinsics. Doing so, we found a bug in the GCC backend which we&#8217;ll need to fix to complete this sync.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also proposed a solution to help us go faster with these sync by prioritizing more important work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we&#8217;ll have more tests running in the CI of the Rust repo, it will help us with these sync because we&#8217;ll be able to fix one issue at a time without having to investigate much about what&#8217;s the cause of the issue.
Some of these issues might even be fixed by the contributor making the PR if it&#8217;s easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I might write more blog posts like this in the future, so stay tuned!</p>
