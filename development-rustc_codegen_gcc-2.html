        <div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A couple months ago, <a href="https://blog.antoyo.xyz/development-rustc_codegen_gcc">I wrote an article</a> that described the challenges we had to do the previous sync from the Rust repo to <code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code>.
(if you don&#8217;t know what a sync is, please read that <a href="https://blog.antoyo.xyz/development-rustc_codegen_gcc">blog article</a>).
We also had many issues with the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/578">latest sync</a> and this post will describe what they were and how they were fixed.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="undefined_function_errors">Undefined function errors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first error we had was about some functions that could not be found by the linker, including some alloc functions like <code>__rust_alloc</code>.
It turned out that this was caused by some changes made in the LLVM codegen regarding the visibility set on functions that were not copied in the GCC codegen.
We plan some day to reduce the duplication between both codegens in order to avoid this kind of issues in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="avx_512_tests_failing">AVX-512 tests failing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like I explained in the previous article about the development of this project, we had some issues with AVX-512.
While I mentioned in that article that I might pause the work on AVX-512 to be able to progress faster on the project, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t skip fixing this issue since I learned something important.
Indeed, while some AVX-512 tests were failing, it wasn&#8217;t caused by these intrinsics.
It was actually caused by this fact that I didn&#8217;t know: GCC seems to allocate some expressions on the stack even when I do not specifically ask it to do so.
The tests would crash with a stack overflow and upon inspection, I saw that they tried to allocate way too much space on the stack.
By looking at the GIMPLE dumps, I noticed that it would create thousands of vector variables, many of them being constants and having the same value.
I don&#8217;t know why GCC wasn&#8217;t able to optimize that: perhaps it just gives up when there are too many variables?
In the end, I fixed this issue by explicitly asking GCC to create a variable instead of reusing the same expression in multiple places in order to control how many variables would actually be created on the stack. I suspect I have this issue in other places and I&#8217;ll fix it when I see this problem again.</p>

<h2 id="failures_caused_by_the_switch_to_lld">Failures caused by the switch to <code>lld</code></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A couple months ago, Rust made the switch to use a <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/17/enabling-rust-lld-on-linux.html">new linker by default on Linux: lld</a>.
When doing this sync, we had a few issues that surfaced with this change and they were quite hard to diagnosed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first issue was a linking error:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An error about a relocation. I had to dive into how GCC generates relocations to understand what was going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="what_are_relocations">What are relocations?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a program that takes a reference to a global variable.
When we compile an object file, we don&#8217;t know what will be the address of this variable before linking, so the compiler inserts what we call a relocation, an information that can be used at link-time to compute the actual address of the variable. That&#8217;s called a static relocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Relocation can also happen at run-time: in this case, it&#8217;s called a dynamic relocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my first issue, I first noticed that the variable was put in the section <code>.rodata</code>, while Rust with LLVM would put it in the section <code>.data.rel.ro</code>.
At some point, I realized GCC didn&#8217;t generate the relocation that was needed.
After debugging the code in GCC that generates the relocation, I noticed that using the GCC equivalent of <code>transmute</code> in the initial value of a global variable would cause this issue.
So, I was using <code>transmute</code> there for pointer to integer conversion, because, at the time, <code>libgccjit</code> didn&#8217;t allow casting between pointers and integers.
By switching to a normal cast, this fixed this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second issue caused some global variables to be uninitialized.
Again, this was an issue with relocations: this time, it was producing a static relocation, but it needed a dynamic relocation.
This time, the issue was that I was creating duplicate global variables of the same name, in different codegen units (so in different object files), instead of creating it once and importing it in other modules.
It took me a while to figure that out.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="lto_issues">LTO issues</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After that, I had some LTO issues, where some tests would fail with LTO enabled.
The issue turned out that I was not handling the relocation model when doing LTO.
Now, we correctly send <code>-fPIC</code>, <code>-fPIE</code> or <code>-fno-pie</code> depending on the requested relocation model.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once again, we&#8217;re struggling to keep up with the changes in rustc. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/578">This sync</a> was to be up-to-date with nightly-2024-12-11.
But we started to see some of these issues when trying to do the sync for nightly-2024-10-08: again, it took us a few months to be able to investigate and fix these issues.
We were able to do a few more syncs afterwards and we&#8217;re now at nightly-2025-01-12.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully, this taught us a few things that might be useful in the future about relocations and LTO: perhaps debugging this LTO issue would help us to resolve the last issues that we have with LTO.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people helped me to investigate these issues and I&#8217;d like to thank them: David Lattimore, Jessica Clarke, lqd, bjorn3, Kobzol, Saethlin, tgross35, GuillaumeGomez and possibly a few others.</p>
